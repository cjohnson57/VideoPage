# VideoPage
Simple single-page web application for viewing videos. Gets a list of parent directories and videos from a [folder on the server](https://github.com/cjohnson57/VideoPage/tree/master/VideoPlayer/Content/Training%20Videos) and displays them with each folder being a drop down menu containing all videos. Clicking on a video title reloads the page with said video in the player.
